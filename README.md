A Hacker News curator done as an exercise to cement the topics I learnt.

The Home Page displays a news feed of 50 latest posted stories to Hacker News. Once logged in, a user can save  
the stories to their account via the "Add" bottom on each story and subsequently view them later.
A new user can sign up for an account by hitting the SignUp phrase found below the login button, Login/SignUp page.

It is possible to search through the news feed for specific key phrases on the Home Page via the search bar.
