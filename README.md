A Hacker News curator done as an exercise to cement the topics I learnt. (This is my very first application!)

The Home Page displays a news feed of 50 latest posted stories to Hacker News. Once logged in, a user can save  
the stories to their account via the "Add" bottom on each story and subsequently view them later.
A new user can sign up for an account by hitting the "SignUp" phrase found below the login button; this will switch the portal to signup mode.

It is possible to search through the news feed for specific key phrases on the Home Page via the search bar.

The Application was Built with React, including React-Router and Redux and Thunk.
Backend authentication and data storage is handled by FireBase and 
the news feed is provided through Hacker News' API
