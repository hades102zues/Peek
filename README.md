A Hacker News curator done as an exercise to cement the topics I learnt. (This is my very first application!)

The Home Page displays a news feed of 50 latest posted stories to Hacker News. Each story has a "View" button that once clicked will direct the user to the website where the story is hosted. Once logged in, a user can save  
the stories to their account via the "Add" button, on each story, to subsequently view them later. It is possible to search through the news feed for specific key phrases via the search bar.

A new user can sign up for an account by hitting the "SignUp" phrase found below the login button; this will switch the portal to signup mode.


The Application was Built with React, including React-Router and Redux with Thunk.
Backend authentication and data storage is handled by FireBase and 
the news feed is provided through Hacker News' API.
